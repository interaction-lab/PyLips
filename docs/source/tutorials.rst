Tutorials
================

Here are some tutorials that show potential use cases for the PyLips library. They each focus on a 
specific feature of PyLips. When you are designing your own application, you can combine these to
create more complex behaviors.

Keep in mind when you are designing your own application using PyLips that your project will be
used by people. It may be just you, your friends, your classmates, or the whole world. It is important 
to make sure that your application is accessible and usable by anyone that you expect to interact with it. 
One way to make sure that your application positively affects your
users is to follow principles of `Participatory Design <https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/participatory-design>`_.
We listed some of these ideas here to consider while you develop your applications:

1. Participation - Think about who will use your system. How might this system affect people with different identities from you? 
   How can you involve these people in the design process?
2. Empowerment - Think about how users can inform changes to the system. How can you make sure that your users feel 
   like they have control over the system? How will you incorporate their feedback into the design process?
3. Context - Think about how the system will be used in different contexts. How can you make sure that the system
   is usable in different environments? What are some cultural, social, or physical factors that influence your design?
4. Iteration - Think about making your system better over time. How can you incorporate feedback from users to improve
   the system? How can you make sure that the system is flexible enough to adapt to new needs?

If you are planning on using PyLips for a more serious application, you may want to implement a community 
co-design approach from the beginning. This will help you to understand the needs of your users and to understand
how context and identity can affect your design decisions. Here is a video that explains the importance of involving
your users as part of the design process.
