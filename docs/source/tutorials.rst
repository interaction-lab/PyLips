Keep in mind when you are designing your own application using PyLips that your project will be
used by people. It is important to make sure that your application is accessible and usable by anyone
that you expect to interact with it. One way to make sure that your application positively affects your
users is to follow the principles of `Participatory Design <https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/participatory-design>`_.
