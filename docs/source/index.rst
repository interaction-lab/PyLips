Welcome to PyLips's documentation!
===================================

**PyLips** is a Python-based interface for developing screen-based conversational agents.
It is designed to make developing socially assistive robotics easier by providing a
simple, expressive, and customizable framework for developing conversational agents.


PyLips is easy to install, simple to use, and open-source.
It comes ready to use with your system's speech synthesis tools, and
uses other free and open-source software for turning these sounds into facial expressions.
Check out the :doc:`usage` section for installation instructions, or fork me on
Github_.
