"""Speech contains the Python functions for interacting with the PyLips face.

The RobotFace class is the main class that is used to interact with the robot's face. 
It contains methods for speaking text, saving speech to a file, and stopping speech.

The PollyTTS and SystemTTS classes are used to generate speech audio files from text. 
The RobotFace class uses these classes to generate speech audio files and visemes. As
future systems are developed, additional TTS classes can be added to this module.
